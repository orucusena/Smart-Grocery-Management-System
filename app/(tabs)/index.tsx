/*
Keep unused index.tsx as placeholder to prevent breakage

This screen was originally used for the inventory feature early in development. 
We later decided to separate inventory functionality into two screens: 
one for displaying list items and another for modifications.

Since this is an index.tsx file, we're keeping it as a placeholder 
to prevent potential import path breakage, but it's no longer actively used.
